/// This class has observable states and persistent settings.
///
/// The ``suggestions`` property is automatically updated as
/// the user types or the current text changes. The property
/// honors ``suggestionsDisplayCount`` by capping the number
/// of suggestions in ``suggestionsFromService``.
///
/// The ``isAutocompleteEnabled`` and ``isAutocorrectEnabled``
/// settings can be used to control whether autocomplete and
/// autocorrect are enabled. A ``KeyboardInputViewController``
/// will however check even more places before performing it.
///
/// The ``isAutolearnEnabled`` settings property can be used
/// to control if the keyboard should auto-learn any unknown
/// suggestions that are applied, provided that your service
/// supports learning suggestions.
///
/// The ``isNextCharacterPredictionEnabled`` settings can be
/// used to control if the keyboard should perform character
/// predictions after the main autocomplete operation, which
/// will then be written to ``nextCharacterPredictions``.
///
/// KeyboardKit will automatically setup an instance of this
/// class in ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``, then use
/// it as global state and inject it as an environment value
/// into the view hierarchy.
