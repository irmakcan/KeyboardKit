KeyboardKit extends Apple's native APIs and provides you with a lot more functionality. It lets you mimic the native iOS keyboard and tweak its style and behavior, or create completely custom keyboards.

KeyboardKit also has a ``SystemKeyboard`` view that mimics the native iOS keyboard and can be customized & styled to great extent. Many of the tools and views in the SDK are used by the system keyboard.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a lot of essential Pro features. Information about Pro features can be found at the end of this article.

## Namespaces

KeyboardKit uses namespaces to make the API surface smaller, by nesting types in logical groups. 

KeyboardKit has other namespaces as well, for more specific capabilities, like ``KeyboardAction``, ``KeyboardLayout``, ``Callouts``, ``Dictation``, ``Feedback``, ``Settings``, etc.

Namespaces will not contain protocols, nor important types that are meant to be exposed as top-level types. This includes observable context and settings types, the ``KeyboardInputViewController`` and important components like the ``SystemKeyboard``.



## Keyboard namespace

The ``Keyboard`` namespace contains a lot of essential, keyboard-related types and views. By typing ``Keyboard`` and `.`, Xcode will provide you with a list of all essential types.

The namespace has a lot of essential model types, like ``Keyboard/Accent``, ``Keyboard/AutocapitalizationType``, ``Keyboard/BackspaceRange``, ``Keyboard/Case``, ``Keyboard/Diacritic``, ``Keyboard/InputToolbarDisplayMode``, ``Keyboard/KeyboardType``, etc.

The namespace also has a lot of views and view-related types, like ``Keyboard/Background``, ``Keyboard/Button``, ``Keyboard/ButtonStyle``, ``Keyboard/NextKeyboardButton``, ``Keyboard/SpaceContent``, ``Keyboard/Toolbar``, etc.



## Keyboard input view controller

``KeyboardInputViewController`` is the most essential type in the library. Just make your **KeyboardController** inherit this class to get access to a bunch of additional capabilities and view lifecycle functions.

The ``KeyboardInputViewController`` defines shared ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``, ``KeyboardInputViewController/settings`` properties, and ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``, that can be used to avoid relying on the controller within your code.

KeyboardKit also has a ``KeyboardController`` protocol that aims to make it easier to use KeyboardKit in platforms that don't support UIKit. This is however not fully implemented yet, although many types use it.



## Keyboard context

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardContext`` class that provides observable keyboard state that keeps the keyboard UI up to date with its current state. It has a ``KeyboardContext/textDocumentProxy`` reference, lets you get and set ``KeyboardContext/locale``, ``KeyboardContext/keyboardType``, etc.

You can use this to update the keyboard. For instance, setting the ``KeyboardContext/keyboardType`` will update the ``SystemKeyboard`` accordingly.

Other namespaces have their own context types, like ``AutocompleteContext``, ``CalloutContext``, ``DictationContext``, etc. They will all automatically update the keyboard, provided that the keyboard view observes them,  

KeyboardKit automatically creates instances of these classes and injects them into ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``, and syncs with the controller when needed.



## Keyboard settings

KeyboardKit has an ``KeyboardSettings`` class that provides observable keyboard settings that are automatically persisted when they are changed. It has a ``KeyboardSettings/isAutocapitalizationEnabled`` property and will be extended with more settings over time. 

Other namespaces have their own setting types, like ``AutocompleteSettings``, ``DictationSettings``, ``FeedbackSettings``, etc. KeyboardKit will observe any changes made to these types and update the keyboard accordingly.

KeyboardKit automatically creates instances of these classes, injects them into ``KeyboardInputViewController/settings``, and syncs with the controller when needed.



## Keyboard behavior

KeyboardKit has a ``KeyboardBehavior`` protocol that can be used to define the keyboard's behavior. It's used by some services, like the standard ``KeyboardActionHandler``, to make behavior-based decisions.

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of ``Keyboard/StandardBehavior`` and injects it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``. You can replace it at any time, by implementing the procotol from scratch or by inheriting and customizing the standard behavior.



## Keyboard styling

The <doc:Styling-Article> article describes how to use a ``KeyboardStyleProvider`` to style the ``SystemKeyboard`` in very flexible ways.

Various views have separate styles as well, that can be applied with specific view modifiers.



## Native Extensions

KeyboardKit extends native types with a lot more information, to make it easier to implement features like autocomplete, text analysis, etc. Check the extension section in the bottom of the documentation root, or the `Extensions` folder for more info.

For instance, KeyboardKit extends types in ``Foundation``, ``Swift``, ``SwiftUI``, and other platform-specific frameworks.



## System Keyboard

KeyboardKit has a ``SystemKeyboard`` that mimics a native iOS keyboard. It can be used for alphabetic, numeric & symbolic keyboards, supports all supported locales, layouts, callouts, etc., and can be styled to great extent with styles & themes:

@Row {
    
    @Column {
        ![SystemKeyboard](systemkeyboard-english)
    }
    
    @Column {
        ![SystemKeyboard](systemkeyboard-swedish)
    }
    
    @Column {
        ![SystemKeyboard](systemkeyboard-styled)
    }
}

``SystemKeyboard`` can be customized to great extent. You can pass in custom services & state, replace any part of the keyboard, and enable additional components:

```swift
SystemKeyboard(
    controller: controller,             // You can setup the view with a controller instance 
    buttonContent: { $0.view },         // Can be used to customize the content view of any button
    buttonView: { $0.view },            // Can be used to customize the entire view of any button
    emojiKeyboard: { $0.view },         // Can be used to customize the emoji keyboard, if any
    toolbar: { params in params.view }  // Can be used to customize the toolbar above the keyboard
)
```

To use the standard views, just return `{ $0.view }`, or `{ params in params.view }`. Otherwise, just return the view you want to use for the provided parameters, which contain contextual information.


## Views

KeyboardKit also provides gerneral, keyboard-specific views in the ``Keyboard`` namespace, which means that you need to prefix the names below with `Keyboard.` when using them (this applies to all namespaces in the library):

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("Button") {
        
        KeyboardKit has a collection of keyboard ``Keyboard/Button`` views and styles that can be used to mimic all parts of a native keyboard, as well as their gestures. The ``Keyboard/Button`` renders the full button, while other views like ``Keyboard/ButtonShadow`` renders parts of it. 
        
        ![Keyboard Button](systemkeyboardbuttonpreview)

        Most of the views can be styled with a ``Keyboard/ButtonStyle``, which can be applied with the ``SwiftUI/View/keyboardButtonStyle(_:)`` view modifier. This is however not yet true for the ``Keyboard/Button`` itself, which uses a ``KeyboardStyleProvider`` to support more complex styling.
    }
    
    @Tab("NextKeyboardButton") {

        KeyboardKit has a ``NextKeyboardButton`` that integrates with the native keyboard switcher, to select the next keyboard on tap and show a menu with all available keyboards on long press.
        
        @Row {
            @Column {}
            @Column {
                ![NextKeyboardButton](nextkeyboardbutton)
            }
            @Column {}
        }
        
        KeyboardKit will by default map the ``KeyboardAction/nextKeyboard`` action to this view, and automatically register the required ``KeyboardInputViewController`` on launch. You just have to add a ``KeyboardAction/nextKeyboard`` button, and it will just work.  
    }
    
    @Tab("Toolbar") {
        
        KeyboardKit has a keyboard ``Keyboard/Toolbar`` that applies a minimum height to its content. It can be used to stop input & action callouts from being cut off, since a custom iOS keyboard can't render outside of its frame.
        
        ![Keyboard Toolbar](keyboardtoolbar)
        
        This view can be styled with a ``Keyboard/ToolbarStyle``, which can be applied with the ``SwiftUI/View/keyboardToolbarStyle(_:)`` view modifier:
        
        ```swift
        Keyboard.Toolbar {
            Text("Here's a toolbar")
        }
        .keyboardToolbarStyle(...)
        ```
    }
}
    
    
    
## View Styling

KeyboardKit uses style view modifiers to great extent. This lets you style most KeyboardKit views just like regular SwiftUI views, like how a SwiftUI `Button` can be styled with `.buttonStyle`.

This is however not (yet) true for more complex views, like ``SystemKeyboard``, where KeyboardKit instead uses the ``KeyboardStyleProvider`` concept to provide dynamic styles to any part of the view hieararchy.
    
See the <doc:Styling-Article> article for more information about KeyboardKit view styling.



## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks additional, powerful ``SystemKeyboard`` capabilities, including full support for all ``KeyboardLocale``s, a full-blown ``EmojiKeyboard``, input toolbars, powerful ``SystemKeyboardPreview``s, etc.

[Pro]: https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKitPro


### System Keyboard

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks additional ``SystemKeyboard``-related views and utils, that make it easier to create more powerful keyboards:

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("Bottom Row") {
        KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``SystemKeyboardBottomRow`` component that can be used to just render a system keyboard bottom row that by default uses the same layout configuration as the full system keyboard.  

        ![System Keyboard Bottom Row](systemkeyboardbottomrow)
        
        This view is convenient if you want to replace the system keyboard with another view, but keep a bottom button row with some actions. 
    }
    
    @Tab("Emoji Keyboard") {
        KeyboardKit Pro unlocks an ``EmojiKeyboard``, which is automatically added to ``SystemKeyboard`` when a valid license is registered.

        @Row {
            @Column { }
            @Column(size: 2) {
                ![Emoji Keyboard](emojikeyboard)
            }
            @Column { }
        }
        
        The keyboard has support for categories, runtime version adjustments and skintones. Read more about this in the <doc:Emojis-Article> article.
    }
    
    @Tab("Input Toolbar") {
        KeyboardKit Pro will automatically add an input toolbar to ``SystemKeyboard`` if ``SwiftUI/View/keyboardInputToolbarDisplayMode(_:)`` is applied to the view hierarchy, with an ``Keyboard/InputToolbarDisplayMode/automatic`` or ``Keyboard/InputToolbarDisplayMode/inputs(_:)`` configuration.

        @Row {
            @Column {
                ![Input Row in iPad](inputtoolbar-ipad)
            }
            @Column {
                ![Input Row in iPad](inputtoolbar-ipadpro)
            }
        }
        
        The toolbar is added between the autocomplete toolbar and the system keyboard, and by default uses a slightly smaller button height.
    }
    
    @Tab("Localization") {
        KeyboardKit Pro unlocks localized services for all supported ``KeyboardLocale``s, which lets you create fully localized keyboards.

        @Row {
            @Column { }
            @Column(size: 2) {
                ![System Keyboard in Swedish](systemkeyboard-swedish)
            }
            @Column { }
        }
        
        The various license tiers unlock different amount of ``KeyboardLocale``s, where Gold unlocks all. Read more in the <doc:Localization-Article> article.
    }
    
    @Tab("Previews") {
        KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``SystemKeyboardPreview``, which can be used to preview various configurations, locales, themes, etc.

        @Row {
            @Column { }
            @Column(size: 2) {
                ![System Keyboard Preview](systemkeyboardpreview-theme)
            }
            @Column { }
        }
        
        This view can also be used to show keyboard configurations to your users, e.g. on a settings screen. Read more in the <doc:Previews-Article> article.
    }
}


### Views

KeyboardKit Pro also unlocks more general keyboard views in the ``Keyboard`` namespace, to let you create more complex keyboards:

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("ToggleToolbar") {
        
        The ``Keyboard/ToggleToolbar`` can be used to toggle between two toolbars, e.g. to place a main menu "behind" the autocomplete toolbar:
        
        ![ToggleToolbar](keyboardtoggletoolbar)
        
        This view wraps itself in a ``Keyboard/Toolbar``, which means that it can also be styled with the ``SwiftUI/View/keyboardToolbarStyle(_:)`` modifier.
    }
}
