Callouts are an important part of the typing experience, where input callouts can show the currently pressed key and action callouts can show secondary actions when certain keys are long pressed.

KeyboardKit has ways to automatically show an ``Callouts/InputCallout`` when the user types, and has a ``CalloutService`` protocol that can provide actions to present in an ``Callouts/ActionCallout`` when long pressing certain keys.

## Callout Namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``Callouts`` namespace that has callout-related types and views. For instance, an ``Callouts/InputCallout`` can present the currently pressed character while an ``Callouts/ActionCallout`` can present secondary actions while long pressing a key.



## Callout Context

KeyboardKit has an observable ``CalloutContext`` class that provides observable input and action callout state, such as the currently pressed key or the callout actions to present.

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class and injects it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``, then updates this context when keys are pressed.



## Callout Services

In KeyboardKit, a ``CalloutService`` can be used to provide callout actions for any key, which are then presented when a key with actions is long pressed.

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of ``Callouts/StandardService`` and injects it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``. You can replace it at any time, as described further down, or inject localized services into it.



## How to show input and action callouts

You can apply a ``SwiftUI/View/keyboardCalloutContainer(calloutContext:keyboardContext:)`` view extension to make any view act as the container of input and action callouts:

```swift
MyKeyboard()
    .keyboardCalloutContainer(...)
```

This will bind a ``CalloutContext`` to the view, then apply ``Callouts/ActionCallout`` and ``Callouts/InputCallout`` views that show as this context changes. There are also separate input and action-specific container extensions.

There are also individual extensions for ``SwiftUI/View/keyboardActionCalloutContainer(calloutContext:keyboardContext:)`` and ``SwiftUI/View/keyboardInputCalloutContainer(calloutContext:keyboardContext:)``. 

The ``KeyboardView`` and ``Keyboard/Button`` will automatically apply the proper extensions and update the context as you interact with them.



## How to create a custom callout service

You can create a custom ``CalloutService`` to customize which secondary callout actions to show for certain ``KeyboardAction``s.

You can implement the ``CalloutService`` protocol from scratch, or inherit and customize ``Callouts/BaseService`` or ``Callouts/StandardService``. For instance, here's a custom service that inherits ``Callouts/StandardService`` and customizes the actions for the $ key:

```swift
class CustomCalloutService: Callout.StandardService {
    
    override func calloutActions(for action: KeyboardAction) -> [KeyboardAction] {
        switch action {
        case .character(let char):
            switch char {
            case "$": return "$â‚½Â¥â‚¬Â¢Â£â‚©".chars.map { KeyboardAction.character($0) }
            default: break
            }
        default: break
        }
        return super.calloutActions(for: action)
    }
}
```

To use this provider instead of the standard one, just inject it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        services.calloutService = CustomCalloutService()
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
}
```

This will make KeyboardKit use your custom implementation instead of the standard one.



## Views

The ``Callouts`` namespace has callout-specific views, that can be used to mimic the native iOS & iPadOS input and action callouts.

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("Action Callout") {
        
        The ``Callouts/ActionCallout`` view mimics a native action callout, and can present secondary actions when a keyboard key is long-pressed:
        
        @Row {
            @Column { }
            @Column(size: 2) { ![ActionCallout](actioncallout) }
            @Column { }
        }
        
        The view can be styled with a ``Callouts/ActionCalloutStyle``, which is applied with the ``SwiftUI/View/actionCalloutStyle(_:)`` view modifier.
    }
    
    @Tab("Input Callout") {
        
        The ``Callouts/InputCallout`` view mimics a native input callout, and can be used to show the currently pressed key as the user types:
        
        @Row {
            @Column { }
            @Column(size: 2) { ![InputCallout](inputcallout) }
            @Column { }
        }  
        
        The view can be styled with a ``Callouts/InputCalloutStyle``, which can be applied with the ``SwiftUI/View/inputCalloutStyle(_:)`` view modifier.
    }
}

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a localized ``CalloutService`` for every locale in your license

You can access any provider in your license like this:

```swift
let provider = try Callouts.ProService.Swedish()
```

> Important: These providers will throw a license error if their locale is not included in the license.


### How to customize a Pro callout service

You can inherit and customize any localized callout service, then manually register your service *after* registering your license key:

```swift
class CustomService: Callouts.ProService.Swedish {

    override func calloutActionString(for char: String) -> String {
        switch char {
        case "s": return "sweden"
        default: return ""
        }
    }
}

class KeyboardController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewWillSetupKeyboard() {
        super.viewWillSetupKeyboard()

        setupPro(withLicenseKey: "...") { license in
            setupCustomProvider()
        } view: { controller in
            // Return your keyboard view here
        }
    }

    func setupCustomProvider() {
        do {
            let service = try CustomService()
            let standard = services.calloutService as? Callouts.StandardService
            standard?.registerLocalizedService(service)
        } catch {
            print(error)
        }
    }
}
```

This is useful for the cases when you want to make modifications to a single locale, but keep all other locales unaffected.
